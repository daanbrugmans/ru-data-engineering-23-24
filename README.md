# Data Engineering 2023/2024

This repository contains the completed assignments for the Radboud University course [NWI-IMC073 Data Engineering](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/vm/osirislinks/imc/nwi-imc073/) for the school year 2023-2024 as made by [Daan Brugmans](https://github.com/daanbrugmans).
During this course, students work on their own small-scale data engineering project.
They must set up a use case for which a data pipeline should be built and then build the pipeline themselves to fulfill that use case.
In their pipeline, students must check the data's quality and measure it, wrangle the data in a way that fit the users' needs, think of a proper way to serve the data to the end users, and consider the lifecycle of their pipeline.
The students discuss the design of their pipeline in a paper and briefly present it during class presentations.

My project was the construction of a beer recommendation pipeline.
The use case of the pipeline was to allow a group of developers and data scientists to work on the construction of a beer recommendation system.
This recommendation system should be built into an existing ecosystem of applications that track end users' beer consumption.
